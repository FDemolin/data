Client/Server ," Client/server describes the relationship between two computer programs in which one program, the client, makes a service request from another program, the server, which fulfills the request.  Although the client/server idea can be used by programs within a single computer, it is a more important idea in a network.  In a network, the client/server model provides a convenient way to interconnect programs that are distributed efficiently across different locations.  Computer transactions using the client/server model are very common.  The client/server model has become one of the central ideas of network computing.  Most business applications being written today use the client/server model.  So does the Internet's main program, TCP/IP.  In marketing, the term has been used to distinguish distributed computing by smaller dispersed computers from the ""monolithic"" centralized computing of mainframe computers.  But this distinction has largely disappeared as mainframes and their applications have also turned to the client/server model and become part of network computing.  In the usual client/server model, one server, sometimes called a daemon, is activated and awaits client requests.  Typically, multiple client programs share the services of a common server program.  Both client programs and server programs are often part of a larger program or application.  Relative to the Internet, your Web browser is a client program that requests services (the sending of Web pages or files) from a Web server (which technically is called a Hypertext Transport Protocol or HTTP server) in another computer somewhere on the Internet.  Similarly, your computer with TCP/IP installed allows you to make client requests for files from File Transfer Protocol (FTP) servers in other computers on the Internet.

There is no simple way to represent all the values in between, such as 0.25.  All data that a computer processes must be encoded digitally, as a series of zeroes and ones. "

Fiber optics has several advantages over traditional metal communications lines - * Fiber optic cables have a much greater bandwidth than metal cables.  This means that they can carry more data.* Fiber optic cables are less susceptible than metal cables to interference. * Fiber optic cables are much thinner and lighter than metal wires.* Data can be transmitted digitally (the natural form for computer data) rather than analogically. The main disadvantage of fiber optics is that the cables are expensive to install.  In addition, they are more fragile than wire and are difficult to split.  Fiber optics is a particularly popular technology for local area networks.

Locale ,"A shorthand term for the national and/or cultural environment in which a system or program is running. The locale determines sort order, language of messages, keyboard layout, date and time formatting conventions, and so on. It sometimes, but not necessarily, corresponds to a language. The term locale describes the local conventions, culture, and language of a particular geographical region, and is used here to refer to such regions. The concept of a locale can be illustrated by the following. A language might be spoken in more than one country-for instance, Spanish is spoken in Spain and throughout most of Latin America. While these countries often share a common language, the national conventions (such as currency) differ from country to country. Therefore, each country represents a unique locale. Similarly, a country might have more than one official language. Canada has two-English and French. Thus, Canada has two distinct locales - Canadian-English and Canadian-French. The language determines the text and data processing and formatting conventions while the country determines the national conventions. The set of letters used in writing a language is called the script. Each locale has a unique script. Scripts are supported by encoding schemes, which provide a mapping of each letter into a visual representation of that letter (called a glyph). For example, the letters A and a have different mappings. Several different encoding schemes have been created to support different scripts. The encoding scheme is linked with the keyboard, display, and printing devices.  Thus, a locale can be unambiguously determined by language, country, and encoding system.

MTU,"Maximum Transmission Unit - In computer networking, the term refers to the size (in bytes) of the largest packet or frame that a given layer of a communications protocol can pass onwards. MTU parameters usually appear in association with a communications interface (NIC, serial port, etc.). The MTU may be fixed by standards (as is the case with Ethernet) or decided at connect time (as is usually the case with point-to-point serial links). A higher MTU brings higher bandwidth efficiency. However, large packets can block up a slow interface for some time, increasing the lag for further packets. For example, a 1500 byte packet, the largest allowed by Ethernet at the network layer (and hence most of the Internet), would tie up a 14.4k modem for about one second.

Multiplex ,"Sending multiple signals or streams of information on a carrier at the same time in the form of a single, complex signal and then recovering the separate signals at the receiving end.  Analog signals are commonly multiplexed using frequency-division multiplexing (FDM), in which the carrier bandwidth is divided into subchannels of different frequency widths, each carrying a signal at the same time in parallel.  Digital signals are commonly multiplexed using time-division multiplexing (TDM), in which the multiple signals are carried over the same channel in alternating time slots.  In some optical fiber networks, multiple signals are carried together as separate wavelengths of light in a multiplexed signal using dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM).

Proxy Server ," A server that sits between a client application, such as a Web browser, and a real server.  It intercepts all requests to the real server to see if it can fulfill the requests itself.  If not, it forwards the request to the real server.  Proxy servers have two main purposes - * Improve Performance - Proxy servers can dramatically improve performance for groups of users.  This is because it saves the results of all requests for a certain amount of time.  Consider the case where both user X and user Y access the World Wide Web through a proxy server.  First user X requests a certain Web page, which we'll call Page 1.  Sometime later, user Y requests the same page.  Instead of forwarding the request to the Web server where Page 1 resides, which can be a time-consuming operation, the proxy server simply returns the Page 1 that it already fetched for user X.  Since the proxy server is often on the same network as the user, this is a much faster operation.  Real proxy servers support hundreds or thousands of users.  * Filter Requests - Proxy servers can also be used to filter requests. For example, a company might use a proxy server to prevent its employees from accessing a specific set of Web sites.

Semiconductor ,"A substance, usually a solid chemical element or compound, that can conduct electricity under some conditions but not others, making it a good medium for the control of electrical current.  Its conductance varies depending on the current or voltage applied to a control electrode, or on the intensity of irradiation by infrared (IR), visible light, ultraviolet (UV), or X rays.  The specific properties of a semiconductor depend on the impurities, or dopants, added to it.  An N-type semiconductor carries current mainly in the form of negatively charged electrons, in a manner similar to the conduction of current in a wire.  A P-type semiconductor carries current predominantly as electron deficiencies called holes. A hole has a positive electric charge, equal and opposite to the charge on an electron. In a semiconductor material, the flow of holes occurs in a direction opposite to the flow of electrons.  A semiconductor device can perform the function of a vacuum tube having hundreds of times its volume.  A single IC, such as a microprocessor chip, can do the work of a set of vacuum tubes that would fill a large building and require its own electric generating plant.","###Human:\nWhat is Semiconductor  in Dell context?\n\n###Asistant:\nA substance, usually a solid chemical element or compound, that can conduct electricity under some conditions but not others, making it a good medium for the control of electrical current.

SoftPhone,"SoftPhone was launched to help improve the experience for customers calling sales, tech support and customer care centers in the Americas in Q3 of last year. SoftPhone allows agents to answer, transfer, place on hold and end calls using their PCs. A main feature of SoftPhone is its ability to pull information from our customer database using the originating phone number. This means agents are able to identify existing customers so they know who they have on the line and what products they’ve purchased from the moment the call is answered. Another benefit is the automated directory for transferring calls. When a caller needs to be transferred, the agent can be sure they’re getting the customer to the right number the first time and not back into the integrated voice response system, where customers might choose the wrong option and get lost in our phone system. SoftPhone gives agents visibility to call history, so when they answer a transferred call they know exactly who the customer has spoken to and how long they’ve been on the phone, including hold times.","###Human:\nWhat is SoftPhone in Dell context?\n\n###Asistant:\nSoftPhone was launched to help improve the experience for customers calling sales, tech support and customer care centers in the Americas in Q3 of last year.

SRAM,"Static random-access memory - Memory in which each bit of storage is a bi-stable flip-flop, commonly consisting of cross-coupled inverters.

It is however, still volatile, for example, it will lose its contents when the power is switched off, in contrast to ROM. SRAM is usually faster than DRAM but because each bit requires several transistors (about six) you can get less bits of SRAM in the same area. It usually costs more per bit than DRAM and therefore is used for the most speed-critical parts of a computer (such as cache memory).","###Human:\nWhat is SRAM in Dell context?\n\n###Asistant:\nStatic random-access memory - Memory in which each bit of storage is a bi-stable flip-flop, commonly consisting of cross-coupled inverters.

Striping ,"In a RAID, this involves partitioning each drive's storage space into units ranging from a sector (512 bytes) up to several megabytes.  The stripes of all the disks are interleaved and addressed in order.  In a single-user system where large records, such as medical or other scientific images, are stored, the stripes are typically set up to be small (perhaps 512 bytes) so that a single record spans all disks and can be accessed quickly by reading all disks at the same time.  In a multi-user system, better performance requires establishing a stripe wide enough to hold the typical or maximum size record. This allows overlapped disk I/O across drives.","###Human:\nWhat is Striping  in Dell context?\n\n###Asistant:\nIn a RAID, this involves partitioning each drive's storage space into units ranging from a sector (512 bytes) up to several megabytes.

Topology ,"The shape of a local area network (LAN) or other communications system. There are three principal topologies used in LANs. * Bus topology - All devices are connected to a central cable, called the bus or backbone.  Bus networks are relatively inexpensive and easy to install for small networks.  Ethernet systems use a bus topology. * Ring topology - All devices are connected to one another in the shape of a closed loop, so that each device is connected directly to two other devices, one on either side of it.  Ring topologies are relatively expensive and difficult to install, but they offer high bandwidth and can span large distances. * Star topology - All devices are connected to a central hub.  Star networks are relatively easy to install and manage, but bottlenecks can occur because all data must pass through the hub. These topologies can also be mixed. For example, a bus-bandwidth bus, called the backbone, which connects a collections of slower-bandwidth star segments.

Upsell,"Up-selling is a sales technique whereby a salesman attempts to have the consumer purchase more expensive items, upgrades, or other add-ons in an attempt to make a more profitable sale. Up-selling usually involves marketing more profitable services or products, but up-selling can also be simply exposing the customer to other options he or she may not have considered previously.

Examples of up-sales are adding side dishes to a food order, selling an extended service contract for an appliance, suggesting a customer purchase more RAM or a larger hard drive (whether or not they need it) when servicing his computer, or selling luxury finishing on a vehicle. A common technique for successful up-sellers is becoming aware of a customer's background and budget, allowing them to better understand what the particular person might need.

Zipped Files ,"Zipping is the act of packaging a set of files into a single file or archive that is called a zip file.  Usually, the files in a zip file are compressed so that they take up less space in storage or take less time to send to someone.  Several popular tools exist for zipping - PKZIP in the DOS operating system, WinZip and NetZIP in Windows, MacZip for Macintosh users, and Zip and UnZip in UNIX systems.  The result of zipping is a single file with a "".zip"" suffix.  Most zip files compress the included files.  After you download or otherwise receive a zip file, you can extract (and, if necessary, uncompress) the original files before using them.  Most software that you download from the Internet will arrive as a zip file.  Typically, by double-clicking on a self-extracting zip file, it will automatically extract and store the individual files.  One of these files is usually called the ""setup.exe"" file.  Double-clicking on this file will cause the software to be installed as a selectable program in your operating system.
